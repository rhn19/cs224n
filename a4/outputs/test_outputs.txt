You know what I do is to write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a child, and I read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as farmer, or leather leather and never anyone has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into you somewhere.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to tell you.
My circle started in the middle school, in the middle school in the middle school, Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went down to bleed every week in the men's bathroom until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers room.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I received a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm aware that we have never got to know us.
You could stop to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to leave you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, and we found it, and we take care of her family, because it was necessary, and we could.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of the cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, he had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about being present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today that today talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around my surrounding <unk> of water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was about a <unk> about another <unk> of snow year after year.
<unk> are born when we get out of glaciers or they break off the ice walls or <unk>
Every iceberg has your own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse and hold up to the end, while others cannot be <unk> and they were <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> which are isolated separated and alone, largely as we see ourselves as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts a <unk> I am breathing up their <unk>
As a iceberg melts, it releases fresh water into minerals that feeds a lot of life lives.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was from the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death of the day when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to really be able to witness a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, you start <unk> the boat has moved on the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg from Greenland, average size.
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single child, a baby. Good.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too excited about the details of conception, because if you stop to think about the conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the <unk> chromosome is joined into the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and it begins life.
We'll talk about them later.
In my ground activity I read two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> -- the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how have the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as <unk> from patients, or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> to people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins with twins -- two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with sex sex, individuals whose general physicists don't fit into male and feminine <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> adopt a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of the ways of having a sex that's not <unk> in the male and female forms.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in life that will be <unk>
And then in <unk> <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body is developing in a course of a female course.
When you put the baby in a little bit of a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast life, but it doesn't have the menstrual cycle, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have a body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, not to know her <unk> structure, I think it will be a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he had a life like a kid and I had just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus on the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a result, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component -- typically a male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of one case of <unk>
Some people with gravitational chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins or <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health on physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgery is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have a <unk> identity -- it means to have an African anatomy in historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing that you have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The highest case was last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called them to wonder: "What test are they going to do to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there's no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> and we are the ones who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we have to admit that these categories -- the more we need to admit that these categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology of the terminology of them.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What <unk> from the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we put it in science, we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to go at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public -- not in public, but it does not be in <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
And our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of him got a pen in front of the nose, and if it moved still not to be <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think of this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, I am <unk> people with any fancy bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
We think that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to think about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- first I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> of the mundane, <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
Parents <unk> <unk> -- to me, the first activists in the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as everybody remember, what our parents -- the <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be passed away from the father of the father to the father and then the son, and so on.
And I promise, I said, "You know, rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that it mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was something very radical.
And in part of it they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> out of the explanations -- and they were <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed away from a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of <unk> and they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women were <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to match <unk> coincidence -- about <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we need to begin to wonder why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give you a fish, the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should be aware of the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old kids had to allow them to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to discover what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: I would start in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before long, June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: was born the March 1 of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is attributed all the rights three months before Henry -- right to sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man right now to be considered to be considered to be considered to worry about <unk>
Why don't you have the same rights to the marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories -- that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now is that science went both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will become us.
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided to marry a man doesn't have to have <unk> and that to marry a woman you have to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests to people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of the silicon syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people -- not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be aware of this for human rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make smarter and smart decisions about their sex relationships that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is continuing to lead this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless you're willing to submit to a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth fraternal twins and then pick them apart, and so he was <unk>
But when the phone asked the purpose of the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation that said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum. Instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are <unk> to change in the right state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation into the <unk>
And I want to say a little bit radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at sexual differences.
And one of the things that have been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women -- on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and caring for those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And so years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who I knew I was interested in Feminism -- <unk> as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
So what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the <unk> question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about her question, the more there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the human brain and the male that makes us more <unk> into complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I know that, they were very attentive to finding the way we protect people in part of the state, it's possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family would think of where you want to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting a new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their construction cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just put it out by the buildings, of the apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in the apartments are already owners and the other half still lack of it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and causes of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, and build a whole new apartments that is always going on, and when the rules of that place will rise to construction instead of putting <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to save new zones of reform enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, they <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which I <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence to users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, such as those rules that say you cannot go and annoy at all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both technologies as well as <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They told me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost of it.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in terms of very simple that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which will be stored there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that to solve a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince you that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that you measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained how much a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go on that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that are associated with them and to fulfill the rules of <unk> so that everybody could rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could have a thousand square miles.
And shortly after January, 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these development regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All of them parties, all the NGOs in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, we passed another time in other voting and <unk> one.
Immediately after the voting of 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in Korea, the larger than the Boston center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after four years ago, getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to <unk> and then it would allow them to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to allow her to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you have solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to move in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million to a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to get a job, work, sometimes they have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think of insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you, TED Talk."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, cover, and more recently, to photograph and post on my blog and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second phone stores, let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search staff.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's going to be from my size?
I will like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all answers are <unk> then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to take for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone out of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought it seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
And inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And since they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in your underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets of this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger guy.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I have used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red pants <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
You just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just tell you, you will also give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind them to their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> The trust is the key.
If you think you see you good with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth -- six words for you: <unk> <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a single personal style and unique is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people got approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love on my heart, and I look at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a rendering of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody that is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put together to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that may have developed over the years is that it says one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird things -- how they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called them theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics -- a few years ago -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to be able to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But they didn't fit it well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I didn't have it.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I set out to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to push it a little bit. It's just right in the center.
And then here we do a very good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal -- a little bit of a springboard -- and that <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would give you a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up and let them go up and do those things, because I don't want to get them to them, or, in fact, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The roommates of the voyage of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that goes on and the wind that passes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights on, then they put up a <unk> and pulled all the air through it, and then you put it at a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only in <unk> the little metal <unk> is free to act as well.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way that I <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft drive, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't react to the same time -- something that has only happened with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean to be <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
You know, it's worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because the difference on scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between the metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as you know?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that we talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and we looked into the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you -- literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that was here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
And so many negotiations and stories -- you know, <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story explains just this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I had no access to many of these museums and art artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team -- a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than shows the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing since his launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there are.
The gallery is <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> New York art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we are inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall here.
Come ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get about 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get from 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get it?
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this looks <unk>
And I walked in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further down and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you'll see what there are.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the night -- I think I'd never seen it before.
I'll show you another of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things that are more here, but I don't have a time for <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online create their own museum to create their own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
This is about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel like to look at these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really not come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even not from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital <unk> it does for your work of art, and it's represented in line.
And the big question that you do today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is an <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am August Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture in the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting to be in New Year's racing careers in the last two decades.
You know, some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you won the race.
This is what is that, in engineering, this is a real time control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that the real control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond very differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the end of year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's kind of like all the existing atoms to be <unk> and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and threw it out to the Moses -- you still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "You can still see a <unk> non <unk> and so what don't you know?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World War.
And maybe some remember, they were played by Italy and France, and at the end, the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, in the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is on the top.
At the early late afternoon there are people here and making call <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
People are doing a fast call on the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and a moment, <unk>
She chose Italy, yes!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
So you see the great peak.
The next day, everyone went to the center of the winning and the first minister ever since.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to label what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be able to see things that are going to be able to be able to see things.
Then we put a little chip, a label on the garbage and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're happening complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day is still there.
So if we show people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology can come together to that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a studio, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with water pixels with water.
If you go down the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
I liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building on the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows -- but when you're approaching it so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
These days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof comes down, someone who was there, and he said, "You know, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it comes down almost almost all of the architecture goes away.
So here's how they work.
You see people <unk> so on the inside.
And here I am myself trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still doing cuts and holes in the water, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> noise) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or you know, but in three dimensions, where the thing changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different kind of guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of ballet today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
So here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures into different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as a motion capture.
You can get the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels can play with them, with the color and the movement, and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as a <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is going to happen to us, we can move from the digital world, of the <unk> power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
This is a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixels.
You can move inside the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to share the main moments of the London 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud, as something you can go up, like a new top in London.
You can get there there.
It's like a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it that I <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> of Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people do you think about creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a medical doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a look of a doctor on the subject.
The great episode of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> light.
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right on one end, is, of course, the most interest we're interested in.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein that's used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the gut little bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about it, when Antonio <unk> you ask you about the <unk> you think of the <unk>
And the gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark, wet, very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to do with no effort of it.
It really is like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional occasional disruption of some hasten <unk> towards the output.
But so, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help they digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in organisms -- every cell just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death enters evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year he was happening, getting more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that even <unk> in Las Vegas in their early 90 years.
And one night he hits your hotel door to your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a gorgeous dancing dancer, a <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get it off.
I wanted to save health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of passing the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us let ourselves fall into the sea.
I think all of us, the feeling that voiced Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily support longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the biggest or the louder or the faster and even the <unk>
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive to the heat of the <unk> that would be able to survive if there were fish there, fish spread into <unk> yet they have managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look ahead at the stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we get so excited that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that it produces a evolution of the natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when sort of <unk> planets are going to exist, isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural <unk>
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing <unk> intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the choices that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
So imagine that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of its <unk> but in your own body making the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or to reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Would you want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.

By the next year of doing it, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs at a cost near about 20,000 dollars and a week.
Not very much for the fact that the human genome is actually going to be made by <unk> and getting more and more in reach of all.
You come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trials in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and <unk> it or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthy life, to remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of one Ken <unk> especially if you could put it on the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can embrace the attributes that we wanted to have evolved the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in order to make a better society for a better society, more successful <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively selectively attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that's more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and wisdom and the wisdom needs to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do is that these choices are going to be dependent on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane filled with smoke.
Imagine a engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day that day.
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I looked at the looked at the end, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the Hudson <unk>
Mostly, that's not the road.
Put the engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more words that I've heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight flying.
I was able to see him in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get out and I didn't, all the fences I wanted <unk> all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll just open.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as a bridge of George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we <unk> in things that didn't care about people that matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have the reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of Wow, wow, I'm not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for this whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow.
A month later, I was in my daughter in my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little kid.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
I gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in a different way.
You who are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be like that, but you can imagine, how do you care?
What is it that they <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relations and negative energy.
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after her running home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has a total paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and her cause.
So I went and I met his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said to him, "Wait a second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they're making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I showed me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check, I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I stayed with his brother and his father there at the very moment, <unk> OK, so this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much on their inner cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer to draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First of all, start with sexual organs, then with bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and, in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on his <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side to another we had done a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> you could get a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is great!"
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they failed, they would have taken the paintings from the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the shipping place of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we create this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of bone glasses that we buy on the shipping side of <unk> Beach, some copper copper and <unk> things and <unk> <unk>
We take a camera that is <unk> we put it into a <unk> and there's a device that's free -- and there's a device that is free -- and it builds one itself, we published the open-source code, the software goes down for free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning two weeks of research, a lot of the last night, Tony turned back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and looking through the support system.
We ran off the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot out of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what it was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
This is a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a timeline, <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were from <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends of close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the University of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show that's pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you to all do every day when we find something that we feel like you have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time a little bit dangerous.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous mine.
Film in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days to have just this kind of fun -- it kind of fun in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in situations in the only goal to try to examine social issues of ways that we <unk> more interesting things, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see entertaining and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk for 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it into ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you asked him a year ago, I hadn't been able to deal with certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we look at the <unk> of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult or so dangerous as I enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to make a film that tries to make products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom at the bottom of the end, it has lots of equipment -- all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title -- the brand <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was <unk>
Was it <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure we put all the categories that we can in the film.
You may have a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've ever met.
The most cool car you've driven in "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> the best you get <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the full process of how it works.
The goal of the film is complete transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because this is funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult the meeting with them, but it's definitely going to be worth a couple of big achievement.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where he went, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, it was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is worthy of the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
There was actually no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what's this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> free simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the president -- even the CEOs the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it actually changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want to make it <unk>
We want them to make a story, but we want to make it <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie and there he is looking at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency meant to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go to my own, I would have to take the door to go to the businesses I was in my own team.
So what I started to suggest from a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking about companies -- the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends who make big, giant big, giant movies, others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies, they say the reason their movies are so successful is because of the live brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we going to compete with these big, giant movies <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to leave, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say <unk> good for this <unk>
You ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for the man as a <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a little brand.
We will get to the kind of smaller movies that <unk> are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that you have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you do in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep doing it more time? With better <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What are the common kinds of common?
I need to talk to you about the street of the street, people like me, to <unk> <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like my <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray gray and things like that.
Usually I wear turkey as sunglasses, or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan were a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call him <unk> <unk>
Woman #2: In part of you in part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the guy who pets.
They have toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because they were <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand brand of Tom, but I often joined the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings you are.
MS: These people do a way to see the world.
A: tell me about that world.
MS: That <unk> I think that your world is the world in which you think about the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case of course, and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things -- I like the weird things.
A: Tell me about <unk> to what do you do that?
What is the <unk> What is the <unk> What do you find in now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> A: <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality -- the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of your strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and that is the nature of <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements -- and you actually <unk> them and make you become a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come -- but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> What is your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your brand identity, your gut body, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're a someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more kind of an <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful as <unk> contemporary and <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, reliable stuff, safe, sacred <unk> or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use MRI magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire for both for commercial marketing as well as film.
We went to San Paulo where the advertising tag in the open.
All over the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are getting a way into the schools in the U.S. problems.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I have had the biggest answer or that I've had most successful ones are the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the <unk> out to their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? Did they happen?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just covering a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> or press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talked about is that they were telling their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks that you take out of those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in <unk> to the risk is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to animate people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it place.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to stop transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> bought the rights to the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let me have a name of transparency, who happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation, and the <unk> Foundation, to be applied to my support for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software from <unk> they are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a effective virus of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, and then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box, the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these systems of control.
So that called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> and wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program you're trying to infect is effectively working in that place:
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs. It was a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information there.
They would take all the points for those to attack.
They probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at when they were looking at the beginning of the system functions because we know what they do.
We were looking at <unk> and information structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need the theories of recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a <unk> violent. It has to be a blank <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants.
I called them and I went down to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part in the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the aid engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better at it.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in between hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a lot of weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Still, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look at a single single goal, but from different perspectives.
The small little one is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big breeze communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets for <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really miss me.
That's the gray box and the top <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and the vibration <unk> which is still running through the attack, with the false data data.
And believe it or not, these fake data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the <unk> in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes on, you have to open escape from <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator.
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can be <unk>
And not the <unk> not the safety system of the <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have the <unk> to disseminate this burden on a key <unk> like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology and <unk> technology.
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with lots of targets.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public done in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the automated <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on and give you some <unk> skills or another one that makes users of lawn chairs and raise them and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force -- which is actually increasing its speed, and it helps you, for example, managing the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connected with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back and load up a mile load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic heart harm.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human owner of Universal workers.
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take you 90 pounds for land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now, look at the users of the wheels, and what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in chairs.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a lot of people who are very young, with damage in the column that they would start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> quickly.
His only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, since the successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was doing 19 years ago he had a lesion in the column and as a result couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that we <unk>
It has some sensors ...
Not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals to board on board on board on the back.
There are some battery that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and you make it move through this soft and very natural way.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom left.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all of the <unk> <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last ounce of hope for my being.
<unk> technology has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs up in <unk> and rocks and even flying <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not only by soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs of the wheels, all of us are going to go to all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in the rainforests of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the big apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction is also putting in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade meat and deforestation is making you can't fill in a stadium or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not certain of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear a hidden laughter -- hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- the love, the love, not <unk> because they have sex and <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us, and for them the game is critical to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game that you see is the roots itself itself -- same of the laughter, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> style <unk> and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case to him, isn't it?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as well as as well as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we <unk> this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual things to play as a game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to think about it, this is <unk> a young female -- who is playing with water <unk>
I think like her, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos are given from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But do we get to the maximum our ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
This is critical.
To bonobos and humans in the same way, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at least appropriate play, you can be the moments in which it's the most <unk>
And for that, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not battling poverty, I would get fires like a captain of a captain in a volunteer body <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are faced with a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site, very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly passed one of the worst days of life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- first to the captain and he asked her to go out and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that over the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a <unk> building to save a living thing just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hallway went to the <unk> <unk> that at that height or less had ended up the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for your house <unk> where, as I would expect, her trove received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house owner <unk> by the brave effort to save their house.
The kindness she looked at on the other was that someone had reached him even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at <unk> <unk> as in my calling as a fireman volunteer I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they're because of <unk> remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you <unk>
They eat food in a dining room, a park park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence someone's life.
So they trained to the <unk> they were getting the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block here.
The first concrete blocks made in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fit together with each other.
Very quickly, these became the more used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, in 1947, it came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks in every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the particular concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> <unk> to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, the transistor allows you to create circuits much bigger and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to designers and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best of all is that they're joining through magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code code.
The green is the same, blue is the stream, the rose is the entrance, and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green and very quickly you can start making major circuits.
A blue blue one is producing light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make <unk> faster or slower -- just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get together to <unk>
<unk> sound, solar panels, you <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took the designers at the Rhode Island School of Island -- who don't have any experience in engineering, just on wood and wood and paper and said, "Did you do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> canyon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'll go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for getting involved with the environment in focusing on.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hold on. Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better with the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I think that time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative for the best designers and technical and to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
We took a few members of members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with <unk> <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
As a hydrant <unk> in Boston.
Here it comes out as if I find a date, but what really looks for is that somebody is being caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good at putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I spent a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accepts <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't, somebody can <unk>
That is, it has a component here.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications -- the last year.
But does something another technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads out viral.
A responsible responsible for <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to have to get <unk>
It's very important to work for these <unk> of tsunami, but people were <unk>
So that's why the citizens of <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just stopped <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks up when they <unk>
So now we know nine cities that are going to use using using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't normally happen.
The <unk> software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that by normal channels would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the court of California that even over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads viral is a kind of <unk> of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the world's better ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the issue of government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they get together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications, every day in their own communities.
They haven't given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave hand on the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that get us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because it can't be <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> by -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know much about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the <unk> center and information center.
It is the place that the calls are called if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He checked <unk> in the official knowledge base.
He didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put it hard music and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an application, and web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
We didn't take that application.
It was the work of very intelligent people from the Bureau of New York City <unk> from Boston.
One day, this really happened -- this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if she's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking on person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government of government to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to move together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
I connected two people.
And it might have connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, we <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people are doing it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
What our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a <unk> <unk> We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to destroy our values and make them solve our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of a <unk>
That's why we call it <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us that belongs to us that belongs to us as something that is operating against that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job work happens.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that you have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism is <unk>
And for those of us who have prescribed the government, it's time for us to ask what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think that we will get to where we have to go with without fixing the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is <unk> so I was a generation more than a lot of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express your opinions at any channel at the same time and they do it.
So when the problem problem does not care about a lot to hear your voices.
They're using hands.
They make the work to the work to program applications that make better work on the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of it, pulling out a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always get cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is to me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, and in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in the communities that were involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with the slavery and her experience with the <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little and I looked at it and I was giving me a good <unk>
And I was so strong I could barely breathe and then get stuck.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish you to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower than 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took my hand up, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "I just want you to <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
He <unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "I second that I want you to tell me that you are always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is.
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So you know?
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a little bit smaller.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to <unk> <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today we <unk> And you are always doing the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I went into the face of force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading apart.
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the other that they don't really see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe we can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to her, we should have a <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on the parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, you find so much <unk> as much despair.
One of every three black men in the age of 18, and the 30 years is in jail or the parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Baltimore Baltimore City Washington, by 50 to 60 of all young people in the prison or the parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty, which if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and anger make us believe that these are not problems with ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work on some developments very curious.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you become aware of rights for always if you have a criminal crime.
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if you put it into the next 10 years, the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without the possibility of getting back.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were teaching people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Of every nine people <unk> has identified one which is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from the death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation <unk> it would never be able to fly on airplanes if every nine or <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery to them.
I tell you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, was a very defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, -- you teach talks, you ask talks, people who stop saying that in our history of deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of today and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about creativity, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> racial without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and he said, "You know it's good disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> in Germany.
<unk> we will never be here."
The room was quiet silently and a lady said, "There is no way that we have in our history, we could never get into systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Let's think about this.
How would we feel like a nation where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in mostly <unk>
We could not get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't actually care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
It fascinates us technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, it is necessary to integrate both things.
And lately we talk about the need to get more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> you will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
<unk> with innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, guidance to the spirit, an will for being in despair in despair and being <unk>
Well, that kind of orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to ask you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting to Rosa <unk>
These women were just gathered together to speak.
Occasionally, the lady was called to be called to say, <unk> comes the <unk>  We're going to get them to talk to us.
You want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
And then she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, she was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks led to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help them.
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to finish the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At the time, Mrs. <unk> put me on my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I believe that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find a way to address those challenges, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's basic dignity in people that should be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> not to judge us for our technology, for our <unk> or by our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with rich and <unk> but the way they deal with the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so they would be <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was up <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you should have to have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black customer is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not just the <unk> but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
Finally I went down from the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a <unk> black man, and he was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He says, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And then I approached it, and I got stuck.
And I was standing in the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That's deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started walking through.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops came, the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- everybody furious because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I was going to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window, and let me hear all that <unk>
I was walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with a face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed himself upset because the <unk> had come into the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "You know, what do you do?"
And the old black man stood up, he looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this young audiences to tell this young man who keep his view in the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't truly be human, if we don't really care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> of hearing and see an obvious question of the audience, of this community, to help in your desire to do something.
What can we do?
<unk> There's several close opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to deal with the funds that spend today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide <unk> not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes are not coming at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the law to make the law to the security.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones you think is this?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
Great growth in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war for the drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let ourselves convince us by the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats by Bin Bin Laden.

And I was going to be able to make websites -- social <unk> <unk> <unk>

Several <unk> War by <unk> massive mass destruction.

<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are receiving more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the detector in danger.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us sick.
So from a <unk> stories of stories that are looking at the negative up.
That old saying from the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, is no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe not that way.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, unprecedented species, water shortage, water shortage, no doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at solving the problems and, in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average income per capita for inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food for food, of transportation and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 to more than 80 to 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living at an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are going to do it.
And we continue to embrace increasingly high expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, <unk> TV, cell conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the past, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So let's get a lot of this technology -- and then we have this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- at good and bad times, in war and peace, in it in the <unk> and <unk>
It's the outcome of fast computers that are used to build computers faster.
It's not stopping any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and 3D printing and the ability to democratize personalized computing, all over the planet, biology -- synthetic biology, <unk> vaccines and food, the digital medicine and the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I went <unk> the best headline than I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to us? <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy play.
Play with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for every cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean creating <unk> life for every single day, it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about taking that out and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
We went to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with covered with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the State to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It will take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on an Earth-like planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about notice, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, at MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have plenty of water.
Let's now talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft pointed to the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
They took a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but also there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, gave me permission to make your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any source -- saltwater, saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
President of Coca-Cola just thought that I will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that we will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the cell phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
And that warrior <unk> that warrior <unk> has better cell communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And by telling you with a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> images, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when your health care happens.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to test these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> you can <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are health workers of health.
When this device -- a RNA virus or DNA <unk> that will not be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we spend about two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds had never been able to get a little bit to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What desires, <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of most health -- thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy with Khan Academy and because of printing impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and you can act for the <unk>
What did these three mean?
And if you are contributions we can't afford them.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do things -- things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and find out the way the protein.
The folds processing the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came over and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the pattern of recognition of human patterns is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are focused on to work on the solution of major challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I will give you three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
I caught it up to the <unk>
Now the fish are in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The ones are still saying they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made more than average in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had gone down in half.
I read the five centimeters tall.
We have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> including industrial fishing.
And this boat, fairly ugly, <unk> called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea of China <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny spots on a few <unk> remains that are fish from coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a soft coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> the <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a living time.
He was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that we collect fishermen every time you go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's no <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
It was going to start the start of start to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you will, this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things called biodiversity, amount of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, keeping some <unk> remains.
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when wealthy societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal which is very abundant -- before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animal <unk>
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with large fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they might expect that the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain such as captain such as the captain of this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
The huge role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really recreating recreating the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point is run and it's very low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine protected area of the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema -- maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched by the movie -- I'll talk about the history of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I give, is Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see why you see why videos are happening and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- it seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage is gone viral gets a myriad of views and winning <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popularity of the past summer.
<unk> did not get a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this proposal that <unk> the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, on Friday. You have to start a Friday.   Everyone wants to get it in the weekend, the weekend.             So a Friday. Get a Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
We saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be coming out of nothing.
So what did this matter?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday in <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends take a point of view, and share it with a broader audience, we accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big inner joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an unfair animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year we saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours of time that has been seen four million times.
All cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up among the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did an old version of the ancient one.
And then it became international made.
Suddenly, a whole community came out of <unk> which made this happen to be a dumb joke to something we can all form in.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What do you script might have written that <unk> this situation?"
In a world where two days of video are going up for a minute, just the only thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, to admit that I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I gave you for not circular for the <unk> but there are often obstacles that will prevent you properly through <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect and their humor, Casey <unk> I achieved that five million people saw and understand her idea.
That's why this approach is worth the new thing we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, all the unexpected things are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
We don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a whole life of life had been supported by the only one of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now I would get it.
They were <unk> in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task <unk> and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her to do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the pirated the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> poison.
If we were to first take it out, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the motor -- the <unk> diving into every wave, and the planetary horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and the journey was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried to do, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp -- <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants from immigrant
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English, people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk> from <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and math, wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> which was generally <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of school for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> and <unk>
At home, we know?
Something was <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to be able to find it.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> guys trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the relentless classical student with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lifetimes -- tragically, <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and insulation.
But many of them got help through the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year, of lawyers, I chose the young Australian boy of the year.
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of no <unk>
As a <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist for inviting me to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses that she had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she got the boat.
He hadn't been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What not <unk>
So I talked about the juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking about it, the more it was to be <unk>
I met people of all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a foreign career.
There was to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, new to the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is grateful, maybe a journey of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone, to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> it was <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, an optimism -- a <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
And we went to a little group of people for those who motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They put it up to good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright, and we opened up a step.
And I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before you finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared her.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he had a <unk> to the <unk> and to take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it <unk>
I was in the shower in a hotel room, when she died 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
He doesn't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since the people who we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would have been easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that for right?
However, I fear the privilege of how easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to you and you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of what's here today on the fourth or the fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer.
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior Indian warrior -- I was <unk> <unk> a bow and a <unk> on the ground, finds water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great deal with me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not to <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I came up with me, I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I was born books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
And so you put text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you ask for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
At a number of times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that childhood magic to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar would always become so exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And really, they just light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy, a <unk>
So here every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all kinds of fantasy has always been maps but has been static maps.
This is a map that goes on, <unk> and drive you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it also was <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts -- the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in river cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a regular child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not gone to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter we had a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then it <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
One of the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through it and actually augmented a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves ...
And you have to do the sound of the wind and be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to be a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University, was <unk> to a director of the listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> we have to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a doorknob and it goes up.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I set up the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, not at the same time that I would need any assistance of weight, or any urgency of that thing, but I see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next week will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to reclaim the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing costs of attention, <unk> <unk> and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have navigating in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saving lives at this time.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please make it <unk> where, and when it is open, then sometimes they open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and then the next weeks use their <unk> cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And you want to make it globally.
We are attached to every colleagues in the world, at some universities to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are pictures that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first 15 digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a <unk> the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this one is a <unk> <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
So let's think about what you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to take an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
Did you get the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if I existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's look at the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a photo look like it looks realistic I think they're those in which we don't even have the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules to keep able to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put any danger of the ideas that are in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to come up to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pump of stone.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island to seem more <unk>
So in order to achieve a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos, the result can be very beautiful and a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the general side.
It's a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something that happens.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why would you provide technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve that, let's say, these are the years, or some of the time -- and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to show you -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something happens like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport technology as fast as <unk> spent tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development of economic growth that every few years will advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or you're going to become a typical curve that I know like this until it comes out something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way in the world?
How new is the world going.
The transition seems really, really confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And a transformation, can you feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time where I'd like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back a few half a half billion years when the Earth was a very sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that were <unk> around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at the time, I'd floating through some <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the drops of grew up growing <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most unequal cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
That's why every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow becomes <unk> being better at the time of bringing chemical chemicals together, <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly, they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- very simple chemistry, but things will become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
And somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to record it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> white dust that I try to hide at the airport <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 at 22 times.
So if somebody wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it were a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy to be a billion years old.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and to communicate information as well as cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and they were <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were put together on it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community are <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came to work so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities and communities of many different kinds of different kinds of working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced the more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened in these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that would not make more than processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities were built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community as the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because he knew evil and got sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that could have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures -- accelerated evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the more <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here by emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated to make it into sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we go through similar periods of similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods, and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you for a billion years of every one.
The next few times, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I earn my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> wouldn't be possible without any recent computer advances.
But now design of such a complexity of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that you did before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of every day.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those that are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tell you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found programs that are closer to order to order these numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But fortunately he could find two numbers in the order of the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that made the <unk>
And then you get those and they put them to the rest.
And now we <unk> the <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we get a new generation of programs that were made of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's get back again.
We would take some mutations together.
And it tries to try again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in some complicated cases, in a few hours.
And in the end, we end up with programs that sequence numbers completely perfect.
In fact, they are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
It's dark programs.
But they have the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I was once in a 747 on a 747 in <unk> and he grabs a card and he says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to provide a <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there is.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing is going faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what's going to come here.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give up part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I try the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and used to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we're talking about 300 of a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to blame the first base, not to get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody in 10 <unk> it hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player from the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 holes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to do this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are represented by a surgeon who has a record record in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a distant place and being wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know something?
She is remarkably improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask them.
What do you think you should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon or a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I was included, to be perfect.
That never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a misguided student.
Once, a fellow in high school said Brian Goldman <unk> was studying until a blood test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the General <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, we <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the differential diagnosis -- frequent <unk>
And even I knew the difference diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were to put it all, then you would know everything, or as possible as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady into the emergency service where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when emergency room requested to consult a cardiologist to go to the patient, I was going to go to that patient.
And to report the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I read it, I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which sent me heart failure.
And in these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of implant the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's a hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to be <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that he <unk>
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure on their heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that it could be <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I mean, I made two more mistakes.
I sent her home without talking to the chief of residents with the head of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone or I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring it out of it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse that she would sing to the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the tall, and the ambulance along with the ambulance they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in the stomach, that afternoon, I had a <unk>
I kept on with my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that time, I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did something I don't do normally, I did.
I spent the emergency service service at home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady who was <unk> before, but another one -- and he told me three words -- those three words that most of the emergency doctors could be <unk>
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other one with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, she suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> brought the <unk> with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of severe.
I barely breathe and she was blue.
The emergency staff would take away all of their resources.
They gave him <unk> to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and waiting for all of the hope to be <unk>
And in the age of two or three days after it was clear that I never <unk>
It had permanent <unk>
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, they were going to be <unk>
And the ninth day, the lady was going to go.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks -- I got confused by that and experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why would he send her home to her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake that <unk>
Why do I choose medicine?
Little as soon as that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And in one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make no more mistakes, I would cease these voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He <unk> him and sent him to his house.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
And he came back and I didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it is going to be the upper air -- and it can cause the close to those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get antibiotics that was <unk> and <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I came back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
And so it turned out an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague that I was checking out to the patient, <unk> some sensitivity to the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called a surgeon in the bottom right.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I had a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I checked it down and notice some sensitivity to the lower right-hand quadrant, called a surgeon in the lower law.
And both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case, I love <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
I'm embarrassed to be embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, mind that I would have a way to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that don't sleep, the ones that have <unk> results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have made a bad personal study of <unk> <unk> medical skills to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are happening in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where quantum infection is increasingly more and more <unk> eliciting chaos and death.
In this country, they die of 24,000 <unk> of medical mistakes, <unk>
The U.S. Medicine, Institute for 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and all of a sudden, my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things like that.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't give their symptoms always the same way.
All of all, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all of the professional professionals who are wrong -- well, I don't have no one.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> <unk> is already a custom <unk> I would tell you all my worst <unk> I would tell you all -- from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. What are you your <unk>
And their students will be <unk> and to go down the head and <unk> and they start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human <unk> they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and to support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes from time to time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, I would give mistakes mistakes.
And I feel so much, but I got to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice she says to pick an American American -- are about 70 to a day.
Not long ago, in a research followed for a week of donor companies.
So the researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks of these executives and the time that they would make sure to make those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
<unk> every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those choices took nine minutes or so.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you grade the way that we make those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem with some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give me a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, which is this very <unk> supermarket -- at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water and vegetables and this was when we were growing water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but I was like, "Why did I never buy anything?
This is the shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit a manager and I asked him to do well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists which were coming every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>

They had a little bit of different classes.
You would put a post for <unk> right at the store.
We put out there six or six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: One, what case people were willing to stop and try the <unk>
More people stopped when I had a 60 60 than when I had only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when I had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
Where he stood when I had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, they decide we don't buy <unk> we're probably going to get rid of less is good enough to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we saw the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of funds that are available to business plans for retirement, for retirement, <unk> <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I really know there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the older was the number of funds that were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that was offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation fell in the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choice, more people will be fought for their actions or the hedge funds.
In terms of the more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize global financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences of the main providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they were making the decision, that it will be even though this is going against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they appear to be seen.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, a contrast and to choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to spend four simple techniques that we've put in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People always get upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space on the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, to get rid of some strange <unk> you will have a <unk> increase in sales, it will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Gate corporation removed the products for consumers of cats that are less <unk> increased <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know that supermarkets, today have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how much choices have come out of how much choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard.
All employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
The people who want to choose, do you give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those options.
And if their employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I am chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience, a holiday on a vacation with a lot paid on the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, which in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very carefully <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses debit cards or credit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were engaged in a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we would add was that they would give the staff to think of the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
What we saw is that the supermarket.
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> Okay. Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This scheme of rating is completely useless.
The categories must indicate something to whom they were going to do not by the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of fundraising.
Who are you going to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think about if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good <unk> a car buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows for full <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color on the car. I have 56 possibilities.
It was <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is they vary the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many options, <unk> colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, so many choices.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to try <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same information, the same piece of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box does not tell you anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all of us who are made you choose to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> in the process.
So to sum up.
I have talked about four techniques to mitigate the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at less <unk> <unk> complexity complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for the people who will work.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful how much more careful choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East East Germany, if you had a writing machine I had to get to the government.
And I had to register a piece of text that was written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint until the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of somebody could do this, so much that this is going to give the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer in any big manufacturer and prints a page, that page will end up having a little print on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to have a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what's going on in the online world we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks in order to earn a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of online online cases, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> lies <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say today it's more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than any of us are being victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with the worse.
In the future, most crimes would be online online.
The second group of suicide involved in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, and the protests, the <unk> motivate them to motivate them.
And since Anonymous are <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a dedicated role on the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the national United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority authority in the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall fall from a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and pick up a <unk>
Last week I asked her at a meeting with representative government, I asked one of the leaders if they were to say, <unk> the death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die because of a heart attack.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except for <unk> a foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters at <unk> the U.N. secret police headquarters and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany who had <unk> the Egyptian government tools to intercept a lot of scale the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to research their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going to be further.
You get to the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to look at all communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's at play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
Now, if we could be trust in our governments today in 2011, any right that we will go ahead today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of 2013.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences on the largest part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, you go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed by the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead because it was the only sign we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and the entire land to <unk> and why we valued them.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
Thousands are warriors that protect our community and livestock and also be angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for livestock of her father, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions was afraid of fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even he helped lions see the pen <unk>
I don't think <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.   They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  And so he jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found out that lions have fear of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn on and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp.
They put everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load battery and battery <unk> electricity to the little <unk> <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get out of it, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see it, when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never came back to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals killed the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the <unk> these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also being used by the whole Kenya, to freak out other predators as hyenas, <unk> and it's also using elephants to become elephants too.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights on the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows in the <unk> of the savanna the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes and he told me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric fence -- CA: A fence <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So I did this one time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: If I got a <unk>  CA: If I got a <unk>  CA:
We're going to get it in every step that I get my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we took all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it was all changed in a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
He said, "When we do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten over two weeks ago.
We're putting together together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering from my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible than I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine dropped to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent their energy, all around me was completely dark, at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, they would see bodies floating on the river.
I can't tell you the details of how we get out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to go back to living together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
And so I was living with a constant fear of my identity to be <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of the back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and stood in the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I would get my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to be <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and ask the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a mate said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although <unk> were eventually released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be tested in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take a challenge going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We're all <unk> but inside the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call it with pride with me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities of North Korea would take some money that I sent to my family, and as a punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in some ways, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught up several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> stood up and said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did the whole path to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, bribes, was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close -- but my family was <unk> in prison to cut off the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
It didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man ask me, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to take them out of prison.
I read her all my heart, and I asked him, "Why did I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unfamiliar is a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when I was doing it.
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went back to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the language, practice of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> across the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, bare land.
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the South Korean name for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, bare food.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food food in food, Los Angeles home from the places of food to take and eat on the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to get killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases, in Los Angeles and South Asia.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more that, say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I would just stop seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house, you see the effects of the <unk> that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see chairs <unk> and sold it as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my home.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 and three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got ourselves together and we started planting our forest of the food forest trees -- you know, nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of <unk> group ahead of all the <unk> of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden was beautiful.
And then somebody <unk>
The city went on top of me and just briefly gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my own garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A fixed order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Okay, let's go."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was a story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That comes to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting -- millions of tomato plants.
Why on earth did it not look like this?
You have a plant to give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy to South Asia.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
And I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I developed my art.
Such an artist <unk> <unk> walls, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You would be able to see what the Earth can do if they stop her canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how people affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool, from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You get rid of how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, the mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my garden, and looked very <unk>
I, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to seeing people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> no temes that people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God, no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get it, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared her stories about how it had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant -- maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people coming, work and <unk> all of them in volunteer plan.
If kids cultivate <unk> the boys will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food affects your mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that they're stuck. I see children of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who were being taken away from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block from gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't get stuck.
I'm not talking about it for free, because free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, getting kids out of the street, who know the joy, and pride and honor of growing their own food, by opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
How do you take them to take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some crap.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
SK: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road for me.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains, a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars go on -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet <unk>
The solution for that is to do roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has the pores and the water can go through it, so the whole rainwater flow on the sides and will have a road because it's easy to drive, and no water will be done.
The noise also disappeared in these <unk>
Because it's very open -- all the noise still disappear, so it's a very quiet road <unk>
It has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this highway rocks on the surface of the surface <unk>
First one stone, then many more and more and more, and so on, and so on, and they can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So you can actually see how the damage looks like in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they'll separate from the <unk>
So if you drive off the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use wool wool from that to clean up, and we can cut <unk> <unk> in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and stones will rise back to the surface.
Today I used an <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, which we had to do a <unk> test to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts for several years without any harm. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the agenda then with our <unk> machine and ours and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface. You can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
And actually, you have to cool the first before I can show you how the repair is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news usually is going to take it.
The Pakistani Taliban screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban took away from Afghanistan and they made girls illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to join my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could both <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could be suspect to where you were going.
We had to hide the books in stock bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of a small living room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we will make our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
And occasionally, the school suddenly suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters are <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. They <unk> in which her daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother raised a teacher.
This is her.
It went back two years ago, just to convert our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite risk.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were times when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I wouldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can stop your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, which is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So you still want not to <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who went out of her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He's not just <unk> out of my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I wear it driving through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though they still face a opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went off from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I didn't harm the future of my daughter for his old <unk>
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and what he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that the Americans see the fragility of changes.
We recognized that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls of <unk> would love me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never become a revolutionary <unk>
We've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution broke out by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men and young men were at the edge, the fall of the regime, the <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage done by the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of war and brutal war and a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, <unk> civil society, and just towards democracy and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on developing capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the Women's Age of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the Tunisian autonomy of the woman and by our right participation of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress.
However, gradually <unk> the exhilaration of elections and revolution like one everything, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news from the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day, the news was <unk> by the news of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the U.S. officials of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and its human rights violations.
Our society, made by a <unk> mindset, which is <unk> more and away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, and we had at the beginning.
<unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all today to <unk> with our success story of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose to be wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought their peace, stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much for men as a women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female being more than need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also putting the mercy of mercy instead of <unk> the mercy in place of <unk> the <unk> instead of the <unk> the inclusion place of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known to all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples all tribes and all the peoples of the villages have <unk>
And so, like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence of <unk>
This is what it is, "My mercy takes all the things."
This is what it is, "My <unk> mercy about my <unk>
That all of you are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a fractal question, which has an equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the people all make a very usual <unk> Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, which I believed my alma mater, my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one who loved one in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, of love, where they fall every year million women, and even some men.
Until his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been about 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all religions, all of the races, all of the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of them are men, and domestic abuse is men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or in other ways, in the families, the last place where we would want or find <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have said that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who sticks, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States was three times more possibilities for being victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had a few big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it mostly on a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- that I had gone to Harvard, I had gone to Harvard, that I was teaching teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was because of that <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I thought, I quit my job and <unk> and I was in the back of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering head in a physical, financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where you go into the scene that <unk>
As soon as we move to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to feel so safe I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept underneath the pillow in our bed and the third time in his pocket.
And he said that he needed these guns because of the trauma that she lived in a little bit.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and I had never lifted up my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had put the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, put me the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure we were living happy for always, because I loved her and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
They just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
It was a isolated accident, and I never would do it anymore.
I spent twice in our honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> moon and threw it up by traffic and threw a Mac Mac cold to the face.
<unk> he went on to put it on one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying. At some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why would you tell me.
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a strong woman, in love with a profoundly ambitious man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us to deal with the <unk>
The other question everyone is doing is: Why don't you just get stuck.
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we us, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has put in end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent bullying -- even after the <unk> has returned to marry, and <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> her mother.
And we still ask asking why why isn't it simply not doing?
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody all the world: the police, my neighbors and family and family, to whole strangers, and I'm here today because you all get stuck.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people that are a way to say <unk> is doing it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> bred <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them and that they would embrace their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I was <unk> with a cute little man and you have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, I would never, ever be a <unk> gun to my head with someone who says I want.
At this moment, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they are being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting their daughter, her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up in the end of my particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse thrive just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They would take the abuse of the light by talking about it with their children, their coworkers and friends and family.
<unk> their vision of <unk> as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
We were looking at the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like that.  luckily, I've brought in <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they die, they don't have to be <unk> now, but I find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These aren't very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to make fun of me, so don't do anything as I cover your mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I have changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take the back and get the hair from the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm a <unk> of an <unk> and you might be wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't just defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> that I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> of the fashion that we <unk> Hold on, <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing both models. It's amazing.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every single role models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> models, only by four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people are always asking me is: Can it be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But then what I would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this spectacular list was still <unk> No, no, I'm going to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> of the American magazine or the executive director, or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you get older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to prove to you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, and you have a lab and you have a little bit of jobs on your backs, whether no matter what <unk> is to say, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but your lab <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're getting into a personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is this: Let's do things for free?
I have too much heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and forgot to wear money, and they gave me the free dress of my <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was going to travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red <unk> and of course, we would have an sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for me, I don't mean by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were pregnant with 86 percent black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for what for them, is not a matter of <unk>
It's about how many times I get married, and we <unk>
When I research for this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of the girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes back to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life life <unk>
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the smartest hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with smart creative people.
And that's all right, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about why every day.
And if you ever ask, with a smaller legs and the smartest hair -- it will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs -- the brightest hair and the laundry <unk> but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to analyze a situation of race and gender oppression when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was most enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I wasn't me who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk> in light.
In fact, most of them took them random distance.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of her first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and the 5.
He happened to come back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife was approaching me, why don't you take it to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists that were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much it would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day a five-year-old girl would understand.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week in October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive it and interact with everything.
That particular time we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, one of the travel, we were walking around, when suddenly he stopped in the tracks and pointed to a red <unk> of the dolls of dolls that <unk> from little to previous visits before.
And he described to me what it was at five years of foot at that same place.
<unk> that reminded of their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in creating memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage everyone to come up in the picture, and I didn't go back to somebody and asked, do you get this picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs, as well as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World World where we have 16 species -- from this 16, 11 faces.
So why are you <unk> they are important -- first of all, they provide domestic services by <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that they wouldn't be by themselves, and caused huge loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the protective and the maternity <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and below Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture are doing very important <unk> to open open sky to open open sky -- in places like Tibet, there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, where six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of extinction, are at the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock to livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs you have a huge amount of time to <unk> The number of cases of anger has increased increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we need to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds. The cut in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on an ongoing problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
It was from <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
In place of that, everything that we did is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we got to seed <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach the local growing tomatoes Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were <unk> to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that the local people, as <unk> valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible for us to do anything, we simply said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> in time to save the people from Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a tomato It would grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> Look at the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, from the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> my God, my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only did love Italians to make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what I did and then what the ones were doing and then to see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  -- <unk> to see the waste that encourages them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Western ones are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root root that means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if I were my children, I want a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "I'm a little <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can tell us -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do?"
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We sat down in a cafe.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you, at a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't do the public meetings.
What do we do? We work one, and we work face -- you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the doctor of the business physician in the business doctor in the business table -- in the coffee table in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia, in West Australia, as I started this.
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this hopeful garbage that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And I was <unk>    So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have started 40,000 business businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in the story, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss from the death of the entire spirit.
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people are doing with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you a question for privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come up with the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What do you show you have <unk>
local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the <unk> entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil <unk> fossil <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> -- communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There's no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that in a research magazine makes many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered together this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> generic manufacturing companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute dedicated service <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the larger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to count with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at and looked at the 100 <unk> of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one person was started by one person.
Never the word I, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment of small business <unk> in coffee bars in bars alongside their dedicated dedicated business in bars in bars in bars next to their disposal.
What can you do you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us are around us to help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't think much knowledge even though we share the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our own needs today and our communities can reflect our communities today.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant wild shows that shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It is always supporting music --  there is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S. property properties.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time and lived in time.
It gave the clarity of the significant things that I have today.
But I would try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to get through the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turn the wall from this house house on a giant board and painted it on her sentences for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died I want to become once else."
Before I died I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laughing at <unk> and they gave me comfort at tough times.
It's about knowing that one is not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in ways and new ways -- it's about giving us our reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in civic center, we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of ownership, it's increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
Now, death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we will prepare for death is one of those things that became more power.
It's going to think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what matters as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
Not speech, but it's transmitting joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happens what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and notice about this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even remember one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be <unk>
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
They were <unk> the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year I went every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would get in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people disagree with it.
And in fact, because their minds are not attached to the concept of <unk> of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though we don't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every single individual manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developing disorders in the world, there is no cause and no cure for them.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new thing to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was living and <unk> in his own world, with its own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smaller things, like putting car cars around the room, looking <unk> and eating anything that was <unk>
And as I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the frustration -- there was something really <unk> an innocent and innocent nature -- a child that sees the world without biases, a human being that I had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, and to you, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the moment we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State came to me, a computer teacher asked me a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth from these students with his great minds, their great books and his big, unknown <unk>
But when those conversations were developed what he felt was, because he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with students with students with students with the students, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care, and if we don't know about this, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us how to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
It's accessible to it's not the same as making them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies -- they are ways to hook it up and interact with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the telltale signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets and kill them their presentation.
A <unk> like this isn't just boring, but it's being supported by too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing the graphics that empowers our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the rest of open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from everything in Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for a public charge without matter -- platform or first, and when he wins, he gets it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament, allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of one guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He had thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use recorded of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
We were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some people wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was about <unk> quality.
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could have to be elected King for a fixed performance.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was taken over for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and I always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the Kansas House was against <unk>
The House of Representatives wanted Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call him King for him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to make the title more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> that I had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> which was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> but it was really a trivial title.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take me serious with a kind of ridiculous and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't work.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is kind of standing there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stop waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to remind you -- is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have described to the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> at the time.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually change the reality much more words than the words might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I am 45 to feet underground in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but mostly that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with solid tools.
Like the other one, I wear a <unk> Lady of light <unk> strapped to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of meters on Earth.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met before, who lost the control and dropped countless meters on that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole in that hole and their lives without paying any reward, and often, dying.
And I went out of that hole and went home but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there was a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> a NGOs who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and actually, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not at the grade.
When you end up talking to me -- I felt very sad, I was really excited to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a little bit up, the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them, even considered my second home.
But this time, I would have the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculus says there are now over 27 million people living in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of Africans displaced during all of the slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk> of <unk>
However, today, you can embrace entire families for generations by generating 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 8,000 million dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery today is operating in <unk> the goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who are producing them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the furnaces of bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering ancient Egypt or <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- <unk> in a heavy dry <unk> of <unk> mechanically mechanically bricks in their head, and so 18 at 18 at the time, and they take them out of <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
They put on <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> I would just pee on it out pretty <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot and <unk> and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning so <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and said to me, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship of that country.
Could you put them in a better situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted which they did it.
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles per mile per mile and they were waiting down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and the kids put them on their heads with straps <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they are slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they kept their homes.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness I told you that it would be hard to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
And I had led me through a little stairs which would give this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local. They are local.
They have small, small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> and identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their own customers.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> fear of <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a little bit the stairs just like it <unk>
There was no doors that had <unk>
There was no windows and big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult thing, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the home service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slave sex every year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interact with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the <unk> <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, a few more young children, makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all the slaves.
Children are separated from their families who are <unk> and forced them to work with a huge amount of these boats in the lake, despite knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat boat came up -- he was <unk> I think her little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
<unk> branches of <unk> trees in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear of fear of the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of her love, it's not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it comes to the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at the age of five in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working on the last net.
<unk> night and <unk>
And it's going to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will come to be because of someone who decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
They asked us to do it by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get us out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
And then you signal this path barely visible and he said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> off the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put my pictures of photos on my head as I put it on my head as they were going on to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied up to their backs, and while looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching her eyes tired, <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells up to 90 feet, and these people carry heavy stone bags that would then be transported to another area where they put the <unk> to be able to extract the gold.
For the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, and we see a little bit closer, and we see other fewer fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends like this victim of T.B. and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, he took it to work with him on mines.
When she died his uncle, <unk> I was the debt of the uncle to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet it is forced to work on night and day on that mine.
Still, he dreams with being liberated and educated with help from local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote possibility that inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and that we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves from other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like <unk>
These images are not from magazines. They are people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights rights and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen to think about these so many beautiful people -- I think I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images show a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that the force turn into a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management agencies.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
And we would give us the <unk> of the ballet <unk> dancers --  that we will see later on.
But the ballet demand for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- we gradually gradually need this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous dancing institution.
In the last few years, it has progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness of <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools that we need to use them to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of an objective way and ultimately, the only way we know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective and objective metric of it.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> That's why they don't use blood analysis and the best thing we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> journey to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam themselves.
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is what I want to focus on as a <unk> for a try, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy as they make sounds like this, and we can imagine as dancers of a smart ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes for the <unk> for example.
And as the hell requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as it <unk> as the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of brute <unk> of the elastic ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
Needless to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to the tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very low cost, and we all know what happens about.
When something takes that <unk> cost on mass scale at scale.
These are some incredible lists to address.
We can reduce the <unk> disability.
You don't need to go to the clinic for follow-up <unk>
In short, we could get targets.
We could do a massive low-cost of cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's disease, it can call up under the price and leave recordings of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thanks.
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have no disease.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and you can do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for real markers of disease.
TR: You have an precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, what we did the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was making <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures <unk> gray.
We lie in the dark, in the dark, no windows and, generally we avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin of the perfect skin -- we can do it as possible and we can get them in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with a lot of years of expertise and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there was the <unk> in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small village of fishermen located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
We have simulated debris from channels and <unk>
We <unk> schools. We removed the mud and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteer as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and punch cards.
They all did the same thing.
They would take them and take them to different places of peoples around the villages around it.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean up the toilets, <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center, the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some who had more than a hundred years of still in the lab, and I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night, I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In other ways, that little girl wouldn't have the appearance of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came by lucky enough photos and it took more <unk> so that I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
In two weeks I was 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> town.
Once we use our scanner in the libraries of libraries that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the photos.
It could engage an hour. I could make a weeks.
It could make months of months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using as a guide the areas and detail the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that were left in saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae -- even with oil -- all of it with the step of the time I continue <unk> that was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her same but stopped by realizing that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would be <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and put it up the whole picture.
When I collected their photographs shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the photographs in a fire station, between the rubble pretty far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not as small now, but their two children were in school in a different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find her whole family and know that they had survived.
The day I gave him his photos his younger son was 14 years old.
And for her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do -- something that he could remember from the past that would not have been marked by the last day of March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean hands over <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- most of the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 things in teams and materials, most <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, somebody wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take us with, but the first thing to look for.
It was about the project -- to restore small pieces of mankind, to bring someone into the past.
When a picture like this, you give somebody a huge difference in the life of the person who comes in.
This project also made a big difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to give it something, using your talent to something that is not going to be computer models of perfect skin.
And to end up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent him Cindy that came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs off our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that travels through an apple on an exhibit of only one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion of them -- but a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light into motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-ray and <unk> the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into a <unk> or it is, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> of just a millimeter of width of it.
And that package of photons, we will travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this <unk> of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons <unk> inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to give you a research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> of photons that starts <unk> and that inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the reflections were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and ordinary bullet and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A day? A whole year.
It would be a very boring movie -- of a slow <unk>
And what about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming from the table, and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light was <unk> in the tomato down.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces up inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographers, you know, if we take a photo at low exposure, it gets a very little bit of light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the top, so you just get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons and millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> ways.
<unk> can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, people.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and it's from up to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and you burn the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera but interestingly, in times slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works, so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it corresponds to what point you <unk>
When you project a laser can record a photograph in raw, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try and analyze the multiple light bulbs of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our rebuilding here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's around the <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by the open windows up.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking inside of the body by having a <unk> and the same for <unk>
But, of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems in the next generation.
So <unk> <unk> himself, he was a scientist, I became the science of art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see.
And we create a new form of computational photograph with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> from a second.
But here is something that's fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects.
The order of events in the world sometimes comes out of the camera.
<unk> corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual liberty.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, put it into <unk> and <unk>
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
Here you can see hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who were struggling for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering out that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
So who have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This organization says that every European company, every single <unk> of the Internet of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company, or their Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people stood and said, "We don't want to this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want to this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please get me through all the information you had on me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of the end, an agreement.
They sell the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a <unk>
And the CD was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> of information lines.
At the beginning, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file. OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life on this archive.
I was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to do it <unk>
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and gradually go back and go forward.
You can see every step I ever do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it on the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we're talking a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me amongst them.
And then one calls the other, and the other to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate each other and what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who send you an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And a result, not the fall of <unk> <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you return home to your friends that privacy is a century value of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, you get to your elected representative that only companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what can you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello questions, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello questions, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, including the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we take it all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one I happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you in there.
I feel sorry for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- they're at the shopping mall, driving in a circles, parking lot and what do you see?
16 places in empty <unk>
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, a living and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial age.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
Many people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you make them <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside, and if we were not taking all the ultimate note -- every single story was taken by my mother.
My father taught me how to walk in the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I was going to get it.
<unk> that I carry on it was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> who had received lots of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 words now, and they're still all of the family.  I think no one realized we were <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot like death of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would have been <unk>
In summer weeks often my father was trying to <unk> so I drank hot glasses on the back, and I would get me on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before we <unk> it was a comedian of <unk> who couldn't stand up <unk>
And now I can put it on your head.
My parents <unk> this idea that no dream could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to university through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all the <unk> tasks I took on the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four Commandments -- "When I finally have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end, we finally <unk>
Thank goodness God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running into the head of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they believed that I could not make any risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts you can't do it."
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to an actor without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
As I graduated, I went home, and my first tour, was <unk> was as extra as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I couldn't see it more than <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> no actors were not white, with disability.
They just <unk> perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, he took famous comics in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when she fell into the realization that I was at high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East -- no <unk>
Some people say I am the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little <unk> rumor that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my father of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
And the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire back with Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I was to go to a graduate dance and I joined a study and they sat at me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the principal and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the <unk> desk to not go off the screen on the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> and hit my chair.
Something really fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me or no older ones.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I live online clips like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does that disease.
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested I even suggested my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as the race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, but I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if you had more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably even need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children Palestinian refugees and a little bit of what my parents got to me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no opportunities, no job, no perspectives of the future.
He has just been living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year I was <unk>
One day you give him a man who offered him to <unk> after for dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to buy a new money to send home to your family.
I show you a young one.
They finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy in that small village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist and the dynamic group of people were to <unk> an terrorist organization with Al Qaeda.
So how the story of a little boy in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
He was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing he pulled it out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And their story goes into urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest <unk>
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them to opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young men are <unk>
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to train some juvenile leaders in a business degree.
We went to some 90 juvenile leaders of <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to large challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a college <unk> <unk> frustrated, was the white white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does it do to this kind of different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
And we encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the youngsters at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business initiative to create a culture of business
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years ago, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and now he's working on creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a profound impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for a NGOs to work for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be aware of the change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They were providing business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of corporate spirit -- really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to put them in the development and put out of their business.
And we put young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from understanding to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park in <unk> this is how it calls it when it's created, and to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired a street <unk> to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their frugal innovation and have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk> from <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was going to make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they had to, who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where you would say <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, <unk> for <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their pathways, I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I have <unk>
And operated with the <unk> mechanics and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe -- and in the days in which it's very strong you become very strong.
It costs a lot of get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and they go across all the day around you.
They just want to be <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that they often fall out of the truck.
I also learned about the relentless of waste.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
You should always be moving.
And also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient form of efficient and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and its dangers inherent in very real ways.
For decades and centuries we had controlled for decades and centuries, they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for the new so that the vehicle engines start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating in the capitalism, just to point out its relationship.
And then it's what I call the average speed of everyday life.
I mean just at the speed of that we used to move to us at the <unk>
We don't usually get it, and we put it up to us and we put it with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water <unk>
We used them, the <unk> forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side to take off of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep keeping us from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste in the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs, and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started researching the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we got good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account at all costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste we think of when we talk about junk -- represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable user.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, give you a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is to focus on the connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where the architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in several floors on the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Addis capital.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to spend a lot of energy because the skin with crystals that are <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because this is a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, he looks at nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how do we build a building, of a number of stories from several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to survey the site -- which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist.
And it's also among two parallel streets that don't communicate in a <unk> body.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs on the building.
And this goes on with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space on the open air in the building that goes through its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> <unk> to allow the air air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little pieces <unk> that are the windows that let go air and light in a way that will control the inside of the building.
And this is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the inside of the building to illuminate the building for the night.
With these ideas not easy enough to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what it is.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the market center because at the end of the mall because at the end of there were more local.
And in addition to the idea of the facade -- it was much more economic not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the <unk> of energy for the building in a city where the electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It waits for the early days of the next year, because we go from the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a 1,000 years of ancient years -- that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access that were connected with almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was extend existing streets by creating 12 initial blocks similar to size and features that there in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell cell, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And they also respond to local rules that set a greater density at the upper levels and a lower density in the ground down.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving up the community of the occupied space of construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can climb and <unk> and make activities such as running a mile race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment that you have as a target connecting nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see every new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair, very bright hair and a small <unk> of pencils -- it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the exit school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I went out of the table of my teacher the book of grades.
And then, I did.
I would have the ratings in my own <unk> just a little bit of this.
All the way --  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself just a row out of that, just for being there, no longer <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never told me.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I never got stuck.
But most of all, I think about it, the reason why I thought this little little girl would be so small, it was so good at <unk>
I transferred to jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that we study <unk> in all its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> it would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no King <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
He wouldn't have Shakespeare.
They took the lists of high school <unk> because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> we would have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no jealousy no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, it almost has all of them.
And this year they have been 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary study of mine, and my whole thing we might have --  and thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat is; but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the grasslands of the person to be reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
As storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details going to try to throw the off, right?
<unk> are doing all of these <unk> <unk> and that's something that I understood understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could do to each other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover, adds to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like big amounts of hair, bright hair and cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came from the photos.
That's why Instagram that Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links fine language with jealousy.
So when <unk> is in his fascism agony of soon listening behind the doors of the doors and <unk> the <unk> of your lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to demonstrate that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are looking for <unk> but in their <unk> they are finding a very strong truth, and in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the tracks to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to make us suffer, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a much deeper feelings of feelings and vital than a wise man that can help us.
It's telling us we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal us to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at lower intensity <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife was <unk>
Freud and Freud said that there was something weird about that man, not <unk> in what her wife.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> described very well how the <unk> are doing it to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become domestic residents in fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in case I was eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
A woman from Michigan from 52 years was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that would send <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For a year, a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of her former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very bizarre and brilliant character from the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books about how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of roof, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting to know what you have to <unk> your self and <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- and it's under the floor -- it takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I would have wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show you the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when you're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse of Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of rat <unk> <unk> that needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but they <unk> it with <unk> in the each one of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you come up with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and he says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being he <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
All fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> alone has <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the scary <unk> <unk> <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, so 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the James <unk> module and landed on the Sargasso <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave me a few 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and universities of government.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which it <unk> after the death death, the last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you care?
They didn't brought a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics was that President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. So some people ask why <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why is the most <unk> mountain going on.
35 years ago, why fly it on <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of the West about the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to transcendence of the technology of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a <unk> context of successes of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship, or a ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles /
Since the 1970s, no human being made to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been encouraged by seeing that the technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be outcome.
I remember the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I don't belong to the <unk> tube <unk> from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew this would be the last mission that would be the last mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us and had enriched them with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't adopt the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> in the years where we <unk> Intel Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says markets are the <unk> in particular, incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas that are <unk> by <unk> <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly is going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at its high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred -- small investment -- before they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and that development is a long term. They have not invested in development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any immediate value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deeper and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to do not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that's never going to happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want more energy sources that can compete at price. They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties development development development, which is a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy energy policy or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they don't be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect them -- the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things as we harvest or systems for the storage and supply systems, but there will be famines of them while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The president Nixon gave the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are a lot of cancer types, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population needs to want to solve the problem, and the institutions need to support the <unk> it must actually be a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The mission that has been turned into something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems -- it's true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like John Kennedy -- there's no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular science mythology as the way to explore the solar system.
In general, to go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, is a very general belief of it.
The second one is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow down to think that it may have gone down into some activities or institutions and that might have risen on others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to experimental surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> as nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this evidence enough?
What polls take record are, of course, views.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is <unk> attitudes that people play when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on <unk> teachers.
I probably want to ask, "What do I do for?"
And that would be a very controversial answer.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some other no."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a certain kind of official and a woman or a person or a person, is going to be uniform in all of them.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the type of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more unequal way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to attract good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a goal.
That's not the target that I <unk>
I tend to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think those people who are going to deal with their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
You get deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, on the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest guys, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see you would see your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> <unk> before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems and accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is it takes more time to do the administrative <unk> that I would look at <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we understand that the system of accountability is destined to ensure that <unk> and <unk> tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I must all know similar examples.
Let's get all that, because of the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> that it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
So let's compare the task to reconstruct trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is defining because we give them a little bit of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the keys enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it for all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do we do it?
That makes every day, everywhere, does the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without giving languages.
I wear it and get it back money, or change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen will take off their physical body to the pixel at the pixels.
Designers can tell their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science of Science <unk> from Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
We had a transparent <unk> bombsight in depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down with every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
We have a lot of us to afford and get back things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands your body geometry.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them be physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel or so.
This magnet magnet, it behaves like a 3D pixel in the space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
We <unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to program digitally -- the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and the distance and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the times the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike <unk> or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show us something but start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to spread out of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only an accurate path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera singer China.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much too much to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class is all the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I got here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it is.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than you <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> guilt trap. and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also brought place to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, I first found this map out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research as religion comparative and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if comparative reading worked to research, why not to do it also in life?
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of getting lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, this is through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I'm not going to come back to feel like I used to feel like that.
Having a dream is really not about compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion is where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch of my office and took my shoes off and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner partner had a <unk> like a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to just move your head while they were making the solution.
30 percent of the new <unk> said Alex, and so I looked like, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you start to go home and then you have kids later on the death side.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me up to Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I got stuck.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under his category -- he would marry a head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on Alex percent is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of imperative, benign problem was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes at age without going through before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream -- a <unk> I want to see.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give their life a way to the past of 30 and <unk>
People of more than 40, you can't panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than in any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to their top to the 28, and the things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to focus on your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are an critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> names of <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade which defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day, every day, really interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't touch -- I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything is right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> you're for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy of the day the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of the chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of right, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on 30 and so many of you start a career, pick a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful doing everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give your son a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I was sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the kids are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, who showed the most <unk> who ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then he woke up her to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got her head on his head and cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning I was doing with her many relationships, but then you kept watching the empty space that follows after the words "In the words, "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I don't mean <unk>
What she needed was not a <unk> that they really were <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like to just sit with Alex like the decade of Emma going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For identity capital -- I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the race career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital identity creates capital capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I am tracking the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to take you the airport, but the <unk> that come together with friends with similar minds limit in who you know to, what do you know about, how do they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from outside the nearest circle of it.
The new things come from what they call the weak bond of your friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or no work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs were never <unk> so knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job of getting a job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
By the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would soon sell her to her family, when he has a partner and a couple of his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit on mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person who you live right now or you're going to get asked now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it work or killing time with anyone who is going to get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer for work gave a reason to leave a boyfriend, with a living.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves her new family, and I would send me a letter that said, "Now the emergency contacts spaces are not enough enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere from the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 to the age of 21, a good time, a good time, a good time, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity capital, using their weak ties using their family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematical students in seventh grade students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I give you assignments.
When I went back, I would take grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a very psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
Is it <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to university to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in the very difficult neighborhoods -- working in really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of learning from their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking me, which of these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, arose an characteristic as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, health health and wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my <unk> of determination and then waited around over a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing <unk> even the safety that felt kids were when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> of <unk> in which matters is also in school, especially for the kids at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about the determination is the little thing we know, how little science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do determination determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a very ethical <unk>
How do I keep it motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the shame, is commonly related to or it's even related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that it is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions -- and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to try and start all over again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall <unk>
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and fast method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic, <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy for basic literacy as you.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic signals -- <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of the web or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how this method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
<unk>
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, three are <unk>
If a person checking your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a mathematician like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations of land.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two together, it gets very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played on somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, hidden <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical you will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in this room.
So a sun next to us, we create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the colony of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to wear a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand to it.
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children into a kind of industrial <unk> <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise back 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk> magician in <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician of Oz would be done today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz like prophecy.
They had magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the <unk> magician is that the most intriguing characters are wise -- wise characters are women.
I began to notice this when I saw "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son as well.
It's only three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level had been <unk>  So she slid in the room and was struck by the room and was struck by the room and was struck by her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> all the way out.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of <unk> resilience and <unk>
He would have a sense that Luke was one to <unk> the government?
This with the magician of <unk> Oz of <unk>
How does Dorothy his movie?
They do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, okay? And not a world of men that are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is that so much of the control capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the way of building <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of male violence films in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that princess <unk> didn't provide the right framework that had served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected that the credits were going to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is over, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on to defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend down the Disney of Disney to anyone of you.
But they send a message to the kids, although they boys, they are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful thing about all of the time continues to look at classic after classical, each of them on a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what critical is when I came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. I don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these films goes the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who so much you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie <unk>
Right?
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Come to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen for Congress, then it's good.
But there's a larger number that this is going to take you through this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what it was.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's a mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think that music music or pornography are closely wrong, but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to take care of it.
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power to <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way of doing something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You have to read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star character, <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do they have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight and fight only stories where you see that their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk> magician, like <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I knew I was I was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, with time, I got to <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1.3 miles away from length along with <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try and do a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is an located place in the Oriental <unk> in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, simple view, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using color -- suddenly you see the place as <unk> <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the former old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is large, it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as he changed the time, went to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that looks inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation in place.
Five feet down, underneath a thick <unk> layer we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of occupation of several hundred years to come back from the Empire and exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem that it's not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in jewelry, the <unk> of the Middle Empire are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> layer that goes back to the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find <unk> here, but we went to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably it was written in <unk> ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really began in 1984 <unk> <unk> in a lost city not a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the <unk> of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They're competing in a bicycle bicycle race and they go in the direction of the entrance door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles all over the place, wheels that go through the heat of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the front threshold.
The lobby, to the hall or what's on the other side of the door, and notice the quality of light -- light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
It's from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks to it.
You can feel their blue <unk> by making it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> fortune cookie and you can go about to get into the mouth.
They put on a side and they trained their living room.
In the room, and doing the maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing dancing on his center -- singing <unk> I'm <unk> One More <unk>
Now I go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> and from the oven. It comes to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len is called "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition which is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of America."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers going to look at them once.
<unk> names of tens of strangers.
I added entire poems in just just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked her, "Do you think you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient <unk> -- invented two thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and that the medieval academics used to memorize the books, <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How is it I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in live television in national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending the bulk of the year not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work, and what can its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see even what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> books, <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on memory written up something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> disciplined and <unk> wasn't one thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time, people would invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed our cognitive worlds.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and <unk> is this kind of unique memory of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there are <unk> in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some sort of structural or structural brain or different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory memory and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of cotton cotton -- they found that in memory champions you become part of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as an armed race in which every year has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there are a lot of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all of the techniques used by the end of the end of a concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox as the paradox of <unk> <unk> says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word. I tell you, you know, there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you say?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name of Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. No relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do good when they come back home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back two and a half thousand years ago in <unk> <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they did not get to a <unk> they would go to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> her memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was, the classroom was <unk>
Let's get to everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies by <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something we all know more or less <unk> and that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional spatial memory.
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to get them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to say who was sitting on the brown speaker horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the courthouse.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory of <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do that from memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're on the door of your house.
And some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk>
And that will remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for an entire year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how <unk> speakers <unk> their narratives -- you don't word for word, which is going to confuse it as a typical typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his courthouse.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these <unk> and I had the idea of writing a large thing about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
Actually, it's kind of looking at a bunch of people sitting on taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school dropout <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was kind of fun.
I would never have expected him to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to make it better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security goggles. I just covered with tape just two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it into a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve a good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this isn't the point.
These are just just tricks. They work that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need you to put them to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how their mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are only shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a sort of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what you do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what is already our short <unk> <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human in front of us, who is walking on our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it was going to be <unk> just a <unk> place New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was a <unk> and I was living there at my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they were all over the time watching the television, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was going to me, and every time I <unk> and I went back into a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
Was it <unk> insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, not a divide of areas of areas -- emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
That is, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it, so that we based on a building built two and a half thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> them, and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use the ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and read and share.
So how is it possible for the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called hopes are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly who drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for life forms today.
<unk> we gave them so much, that we move away from the people.
All of the black, this is why you think we feel very good, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to those symbols of <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to experiment with <unk> we do swing the <unk> over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, it was taken from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk>
It really hard.
So we zoom in in the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
It turns the New York again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that's great.
We all spent the time at the commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies in them.
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or to the Italian <unk>
You can perhaps have a fish sticks with bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects get frustrated and we started making swing the New York City <unk>
In the 1980s and the early '90s, we started to experiment with the <unk>
We <unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques, and we have new design techniques techniques, and we find new ways -- some ways that would fit against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the New <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk> happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public <unk> were completely aware of a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these are wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The main mayors did the main mayors of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials with other architects star.
I went to <unk> and I went to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they'd have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
They don't seem to be a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, in communication, it starts to swing more and faster, and then it's going to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, among us, architects and you, the audience.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community community.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly at the day, and there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media <unk> because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by putting these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what architecture we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
And we would try to bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which doesn't embrace something that has never seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave it through architecture.
That means that the <unk> of one another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in ancient city <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of the red brick of red brick based on ideas of what a <unk> should be.
And this means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Florida, also can serve sports or for <unk> or even you can marry them at night.
This means three architects can dream of swimming on the East Side of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, no longer is a customer alone.
It means no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent, more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides of <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot at play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the most competitive spaces -- local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and already started walking.
And it does it in that great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do this -- and he made me think, when did you stop doing this?
How is it all of a sudden we're not really comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for the show, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, although his mom tells him all the long time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Among his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school colleagues say, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her, it publishes it on YouTube, and he publishes on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal and <unk> teenager who gets these answers into one of the stages of their more emotionally vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a live living and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is that you have the digitally.
What is the most important thing in your life of someone in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the children's news now.
<unk> zero <unk> remain <unk>
<unk> <unk> is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people might expect.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the sports stars and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, you probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways they start suffering.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to challenge society and the developing field.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in <unk> debates -- to participate in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention to their physical form.
One in five aren't attending classes at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season, if you don't think you see you good, specifically if you don't think you're nice enough -- you get a note lower than the average of your fellow who don't care about what it looks like.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it gives it independently of what these young people actually weigh about.
So, in order to stay right, we are talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
<unk> on his body is <unk> the academic performance of his body.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> at least are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy than you can take them to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and of drugs, diet -- aesthetic surgery, aesthetic sexual relationships, and no longer protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is taking the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we are not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview on one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be that <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, alone doesn't take you too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of software available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus in six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone who are willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is <unk> but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good at the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as you can see.
All of us can begin to do it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and the comments we published on our social networks.
We can tie people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow to to be valuing their whole person, to valuing its <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make it be the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that you have never been aware of being seen as the ones they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
So your <unk>
So your <unk>
So your <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is standing in a distance. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in her interior, which was blown away because of having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this and we would call it for the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are now attached to everyone.
But let's get to our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love love for those who are and what they do, and because of what they do, and because they feel like they feel.
We went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become <unk> agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five November of 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense League <unk>
<unk> initially said that they were naive, but being a prisoner of other people in the company of others, they started planning on attacks of about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans was <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, was not allowed to escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, an American school teacher in the two and made it all possible for giving me happy.
Just when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get to want the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in the whole human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so attached to their convictions that they think we need to use every possible media for everyone to live as them.
A few months before her arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last few weekends, he and a few friends, had been going to focus on top of Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched myself my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained to me how to aim about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot shot -- I gave the little light orange on the target and, to surprise everybody, especially of mine, all the target broke on flames.
My uncle turned to the others and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
May such a parent, such a kid.
All of all, the comment took a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a hundred pounds of explosives in the parking parking lot on the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved on 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone -- it was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
My identity to avoid being the white man, but it will be the new of the silent class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't develop social skills, so that they can be able to put it very under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
And I was charged with opera to judge people, based on indicators of <unk> like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention, <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, because I had been a <unk> victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group would come from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I met people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all gay men were bad enough.
It happened to be a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the toughest and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, developed a sense of empathy for the suffering from others, but it was not easy for me to treat native people, exactly how I would have wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I could contrast to the stereotypes that I had taught as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is about the homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All nights, Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and I helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing and a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point I realized how much negative energy you need to keep that hatred inside of your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, who is going to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- which even though I was attached to this ideology of violent and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the creation of terrorism and for their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has made them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those of those <unk> acts of my father's actions.
With this light, I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or -- that the kids don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this moment, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has color, flavor and texture.
Do you feel your body, your pain, you're hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious of conscious thinking.
The movie of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the most fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you, you and you.
There's nothing to get more directly.
At least, I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate the awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Now, science, for nature, is an objective for us.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective things.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, you will see that vision.
<unk> psychology is the <unk> behavior, neuroscience is studying the brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientists in consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science of languages.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of neuroscience work -- some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are easy problems.
No offense to <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it's not addressing the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is an internal <unk> movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
<unk> <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they are <unk> how the <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how it works.
That might be applying to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a phenomenon -- how we <unk> how we speak, how we play <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still has a lot to say.
I'm a heart scientist of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that it works. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell you at this point.
We have a big chain of explanations -- great, great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
And then we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness right now is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that were at beginning to live before to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film it includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is what it takes to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to you.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time we get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
They were <unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic.
On the contrary, you think it looks principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, laws of Newton. And I applied the core laws of <unk> and he <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we found ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, load, then by a matter of logical you have to add the <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the awareness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the time, the mass of <unk>
physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, not only humans, the dogs, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some particular sense of crude feeling -- some of the early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think about something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the awareness with information.
Because there is always information processing, and there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex <unk> as a human being complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, I took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information, a high degree of information, a high degree of consciousness.
In a mouse is a degree of integration integration of information, as a lot of significant awareness of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of <unk>
In fact, there's a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying it.
As Stephen Hawking's explains Stephen Hawking, where is the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that view, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to restore our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get lots of hungry.
I think this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral terms, it's not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has an integrated information processing information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, there are really serious ethical problems on the ethic of development of development systems of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, and at this moment, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full TED group, different from the different TED, different from every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
<unk> raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to figure out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, <unk> my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has not gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
So years later, I was in the second part of teaching myself in a <unk> high school high school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you send your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about things like <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had experiences with disability as inspiration objects.
And it's not. And it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage I'm going to focus on what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid by <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something called a <unk> a capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and you don't make a fantastic thing.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands by drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a boy running with a carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will improvise the disabled of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been approached by strange <unk> expressing that you think I'm a brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was standing in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images -- those images that are providing people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
We have a few things.
But the things we overcome are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called a social model of disability, that tells us that we are more likely because of the society that we live from our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I have learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies taking out the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us exceptional <unk>
I honestly don't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the resourceful trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is that it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs hasn't made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> before a television screen will not turn the <unk> for people to <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl was sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> is not considering nothing for being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> by climbing off the bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 degree school is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at <unk> reality and professional reality with the <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get away.
When people think of reality <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would leave with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man for 110 pounds -- I was trying to <unk> it with all his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So I would show you some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is an submarine up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
<unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field -- from the perspective of the <unk>
You might have noticed that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get ourselves to the next <unk>
We take it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in Russian rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and making a <unk> What will the experience of a fan will be.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball on the bottom of the network?
What will your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk>
<unk> the augmented reality when the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners would see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win.
So, here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore got a <unk> in his field <unk> in order to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster.
In <unk> imagine you're a player to go back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're in. You won't have to worry about a <unk>
or <unk> the strategy.
They just come out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate to lose <unk>
You lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want to that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information goes to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is going to take the good equipment out of the bad guys.
So your team of computing will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being for nerds.
It will also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
I would take the ball and get it.
<unk> an open receptor. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight is going to tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
It's going to be <unk> in the protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open receiver here.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, yet the receptor sees its bombsight -- an area of grass and it can change the race.
He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The public <unk> and <unk> have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You don't want to be in the field, <unk>
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We'll use it only as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth?
How much is it true for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, as usual.
Thank you.
I recently passed me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- I spent the end of the <unk> Lofa County, which includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure -- known to its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a decent chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which <unk> our vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones who don't usually get in the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this suicide method will realize the <unk> death that they are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have before they had to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darkest time, it's very difficult to bring you back back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, clinical officers are trained to train new official things.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him from July 22 last year to receive a call from a possible suicide guy sitting in the <unk> near the center.
And when I got there, I noticed Jason talking with an officer of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason had only 32 years and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown until two times before New Jersey and trying to kill her from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I wondered if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> he created <unk> and he sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of her <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So we said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and left.
This kind of kind and intelligent guy in New Jersey had just taken out of his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason got to order.
<unk> damage damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved being <unk>
What do you find?
So what does that mean?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understanding.
You don't get <unk> or you say to the person you know how it feels because they probably don't get it.
I'm just standing there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you her letter.
She lost his son on January 19th of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED Conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends telling your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing the more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having a true mental illness anymore.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I wrote a phone call for a possible suicide guy on the sidewalk near the northern tower near the north.
I took my blog off the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half the next hour I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to take that day back on that lane and give her a whole other chance.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said to him, "What did it do is what he made you <unk> and gave him the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you to you."
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events on September 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> by help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness -- which has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thanks to God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like <unk>
We give God for you.
I'm going on debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writing, <unk> <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you <unk> like the patient.
I know I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk openly about the events that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> isn't just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk>
That act, despite finishing your own pain, there is a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people, or those who consider suicide, wouldn't think hurt someone else.
They just want their own pain to <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness, and so-called suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents I've been directly involved with -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I would raise her hand at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave next to the railing was realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to San Francisco, but also to people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should work on to do.
suicide, you can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your inside you know what you are, and a question will you? How do you bother that?
I must be a unique thing in that way, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model of model, I felt that I had had the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go ahead when I look at this picture, I think, I think, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just getting started.
We all care about our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or because of the beliefs of those who are us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my neighbors -- my <unk> agent -- ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had <unk> as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why is you always wearing that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to make it <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, actually, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I would never tell you to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be a bad thing, but why the world comes to those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who just accept me as I am.
Many of them are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these kinds of mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up with me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was over the <unk> and the wardrobe and that night, I won in a bath, I won in <unk> I won in a <unk> and was a third finalist between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, it was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was from queen of beauty of women, but I can do that.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends from that community.
In 2001 -- my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that my request from the green card I could go to living in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you gave the U.S. to the United States you can change your name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put my name on my name.
She also accompanied me when I was left in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to do the most sophisticated and sophisticated surgeries secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many of them are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living on, he lived his truth, but <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every third of November we make a global vest for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who <unk> and stood in front of the injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others to live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day no longer has ever been <unk>
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
My parents of my parents for my parents -- I know it's very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who were <unk> and a few times, when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't follow it, and she would take my mom and she said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other not. It's just gender identity, that's what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes a few times that <unk> didn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with them.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In many societies.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> National Prize.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the story of <unk> inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you're born a child, her birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome and by his father, not by your mother.
<unk> comes up with the mother and a mother and nobody <unk>
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just your mother, but the daughter, <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you got home and the school admits of his brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, somehow, has a good life.
You can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years, you will prohibit her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and her brothers and her family and her family, and if you were able to <unk> the code of that of course honor, and it could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this of course, of honor code, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of the course of honor.
And there's a more rules of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the best thing.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions.
If you hold it with a man who doesn't like or if it was <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, they have to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then give birth to more and more <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I got it, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half and a half years <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a child of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in the United States, in a lot of developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and your name.
A <unk> means that has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where you can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when we <unk> the form of a Canadian <unk> and he was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends would come to me.
The encouraged going to me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, paid for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights to human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools.
Girls have banned them to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10, <unk> he got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, to the BBC, he was offered to him for the documentaries of the New York Times, and he spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, he was shot to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read him at the ear of my wife and "I have <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And they <unk> he said, "Please don't give you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital, and I had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile with my smile on my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please do not get away.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when not just his homework.
They fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my <unk> that has made so bold to <unk> so brave expressive and <unk>
I tell you, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut her wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google Google group, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you cling to a brain operation.
You are still as smart or not?
Not to be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what quantity to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals and mix up and try to stay alive.
I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul for what I decided to do to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try and make it mixed up, and I was amazed at seeing how small changes in the dose -- dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemicals for a man in 1900s, and I was surprised to see how I would understand my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time at sex and believed to me that it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've known several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was able to get a little bit of them to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do, I've got better with men.
What I was trying to do is to <unk> those hormones and <unk> and so forth, I was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my ideas of ideas.
<unk> to think almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference to the way I can find these mental images I use to create <unk> my ideas, whether they were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the brain works, for me is simple: for most of us, mental imagery are fundamental for thinking <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> -- really sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take very quickly these mental imagery of my mind to the screen screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what would happen if a theater director would be able to use his imagination only to lead the world in the way?
Or if a musician could get the music from his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can come to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments done by two recent experiments made by the leading <unk>
Both of them used MRI technology, an functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain here, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows you the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
And this is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into the visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- people new animals, and as much as it was <unk> a new <unk>
And the computer using just the scanning brain information -- you know, to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right near to do this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you can imagine that same picture, you can think of the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain of brain scanning brain systems, available today, and their resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I can't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets but at this point, magnets more <unk> they provide small improvements at resolution -- it's not gains for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets make better magnets.
We can create structures much more complex with slightly different arrangements -- like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make it really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and brilliant solutions are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio frequency spot in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field, they will be able to ban magnetic patterns structured and structured radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns -- we can dramatically increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of blood -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to write our ideas in a direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over language and communicate directly by <unk>
What would you be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure cure and similar disease.
We have few options more than open this door.
But anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll tell you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay country.
I think we all have <unk>
His self may be saying to some person for the first time you love it, or saying to someone who's pregnant, or saying to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
Everything I think is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet that's a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side of the South Side of the South Side of a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote from the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope to the <unk> of my short pants and having <unk> my head a little bit, I would usually ask me a little <unk> "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear to be very awkward at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and we put it inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was <unk> and I was about to go into the female issues at the table --  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even one piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a breath out of it, and I went down and I went down and on my backs -- a four-year-old girl with a pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you kid.
And so I took it down again again, I set up with it close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and you saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a rose dress and you sometimes like to use a comfortable ninja
Now, I'm more than a girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right, "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both we were terrified of one with the other.
So as a lot of us, I've lived in a few <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons for why you get out of my closet it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> how hard it is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared them to be offered to banking is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your son of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to respect to what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made out of your walls, a closet that's not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that I had a horse of horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian ready to fight any child in four years to get the coffee.
I was frozen by <unk> <unk> in one corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and the move only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of the most memorable grenade was on my sister.
It was the first time most guests knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> of honor, in my black dress and <unk> and I walked around the tables and finally I got to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women laughed at <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite singing TV show.
Our favorite <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in hopes of desperately trying his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at the time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you can do.
It's like the hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it implies you will get out of any reason is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Would it be <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee was not <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other you need to know that we also do suffer.
Number two: Be direct <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of you can come out and be injured safe, so they have done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
These are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And it might feel very much of us, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- an example of a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's step back into a walk.
We start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept of intelligence on the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that we put on the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to seem like <unk> for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will embrace the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked him for a number of years ago: and there's a mechanism behind the intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time <unk>
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
Design is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life they should have tendency to be more favorable than the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more controversial relationship.
What if smart behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually actually comes directly from it.
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could get multiple evidence of animal intelligence, to play of humans, and even make money <unk> actions, all of them without being known to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human technologies.
This ability of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling off opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where the friends are constantly falling up and keeps successful the network right connected.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we organize the routes of a fleet of boats, and we try to succeed and using the Panama Panama to expand the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated array of <unk> of actions, successfully increasing assets under its exponentially.
This risk management skill will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different human behaviors such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation all derive from one equation, leading to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the robot, the <unk> piece, there was always the concept that if we were to say, smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, <unk>
The machines are transferred against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all of the concept of rebellion <unk> the reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants for helping the descendants for helping them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, the intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint line of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of growing worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not no scientific scientist or no <unk>
But the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for aliens in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the planet -- more than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet, and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be a potentially habitable world that shows this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and on part, is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> tracks its surface for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Local companies are now offering not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images -- they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the equatorial areas of our planet that still stay in <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen, by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will take a great and sad <unk> and the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable on Earth.
For a lot of which you like my exploration, I'm deep to disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party really will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with an experiment with the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi Fermi said, having in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become very advanced enough to be able to consider to continue to live between the stars, lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization, <unk> we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> planetary exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to tackle the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would get my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window out of the dining room, where I had <unk>
So fast I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all of them were pretty closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff enough to spend night because I had an early flight to the morning, and I was afraid of my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but no more expensive than a <unk> at a half a night, so I thought, despite the <unk> of the circumstances right there.
I'm a profession I know a little bit about how the brain works under <unk>
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put bad things out of it, that I would think bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you know, the chance of a total catastrophe is a total of catastrophe going on.
So I started thinking about that, but even one month later my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he talked to him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look ahead and tries to figure out all the things that might be wrong, and then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out and to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to be tracking the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish, the trees -- the <unk> trees where the female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at home you <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and you are <unk> with it that your stuff will always be there.
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license license, passport, <unk> yourself in the mail that you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your cortisol.
The <unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of your medical care or the one to be dear to helping them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making and in medical decisions and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from the people that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most physicians of people don't want to talk, and the drug companies are even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic -- it's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's someone's fault -- it's the scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to research from the cynical researchers to <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently by <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic -- and it is, <unk> of <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do that with time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
One has 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that the drug helps you help you.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The healthcare ethic is part of the beginning of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in air by the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to try is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do more is done in the biggest men in 50 percent of the prostate cancer -- the number you need to deal with is <unk>
That's how 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case is produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before time, the questions that you can argue to you that we will make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this all on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the opinion in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, not react very quickly. They could get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, as <unk> <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to focus on the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize the harm, or to prevent the bad things on the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor settled on a combination of combination along with the door, with a key from the door door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered anymore, and lots of messages in mail I read that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing an musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be -- I would never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the sign system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign came over the year in the 1800s, and over the time, they mixed with local signs, and developed the language we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following people's rules, and <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"You don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't get covered in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's about coming next.
So this drawing.
hey.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that is not natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there were no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There were no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
Is this going to me about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it very <unk> or experience it visually, or even a idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that I could be able to <unk> me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as and become my voice.
In that way, I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a kind of temporary value for a very high interest rate.
If I would not continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic <unk> <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, one musical note cannot be capture and express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
Two are very strongly and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divided into many different <unk>
If you zoom in a different <unk> for every finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so as you play the piano, the English piano is a linear language, as if you get it just a key at the same time.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a <unk> concept or an idea of <unk>
If only a key would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I got stuck.
Kadoom. oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I set up to think, and if I look at <unk> through <unk> lens.
If I had to create a sign and fold it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out, and you get it.
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you take it down the sound itself, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said by <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is getting closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> the same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of my hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yes, so good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it over again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please forgive me again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. Everyone on your head and the chest -- but they make it very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very competitive world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound automatically -- it doesn't automatically have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to <unk>
<unk> is a rich trove of trove -- and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a ignorance of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and they're not very good to clean those from others.
The time -- now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in <unk> <unk>
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach -- with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, they're not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to gather those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use those huge lights.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> work with <unk> <unk> so that the very young kids can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is trying to take the best ideas from every child and try to get it into something that we hope it works.
So we decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, only information information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned down light bulbs and web cameras on sectors and they put it into a floating robot that gets slowly moving through the water and by plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating floating through the sensor while the computer computer computer process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would take it even more.
The cool thing on this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix them immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, you can see the Internet, and you get stuck with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, clay and oil are also brown and when you all mix -- it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I asked a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I was forced to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons of <unk> are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has secure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and investigate independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Along with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day, and we talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the <unk> <unk> map to represent the real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this, we could notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We were approaching to 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment, as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can become children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in mobility of the elderly population transforming their chairs in the standard wheels on new <unk>
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So American citizens, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes of <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk string of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is placed on the environment, the other I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the silent, <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool by Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to work on it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made dictated by the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of different kinds of functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are thicker with little <unk>
One acts mainly like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually changing its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents the double personality view of every designer and architect and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthetic is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask you why now?
Why couldn't this be 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where they produce four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet your mind and my students' hands.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, from large-scale feet, like this robotic arm with an scope of 24 feet in diameter with a <unk> basis that some day not very distant to print <unk> and graphics buildings made of genetically genetically engineered <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where each opening is the size of only to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion with <unk> go <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing 3D printing we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> of the cells, let me show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner here.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the safe structural chair and also absorb sound.
The <unk> professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
It takes this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, and color points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, changes its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and got to define a lot about what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends up to the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees grow up with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design look like if the objects were made out of a single piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material to put the kind of material from the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant of the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produce every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune out your properties, we could generate structures that are embedded in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a bunch of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- chemical <unk> we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single <unk> material, 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, it leaves the dry leaves to find a natural form of the contact with the air.
So why do we continue designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process of printing used to contain toroidal <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture the genetically engineered of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> to mesh -- and if it extends even more, even window.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with a old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that are made of shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to get them in the sea, you know, <unk> life and put in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> chart did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> just that instead of putting it out of metals -- metals that are <unk> new biological problems within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We were able to get our own 3D channels to control these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the opposite water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human eye.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you organize these bacteria and to make it <unk>
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality of <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they get more transparent channels.
This <unk> <unk> system when you stretch away from one end to each other, goes down 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our very little gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> bright channels with life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said he said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that are going to increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the tissue plans and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer made material into layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which those fibers are each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turned on the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of environment, and we've found that shape -- the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to more dark and <unk> and so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we can create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat picks up the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> silk worms to a online silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them very carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
As a biological silk about <unk> <unk> silk is giving all this pavilion to their integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
An <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a different ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back to us, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands us, for the first time, we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked this?
They can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and he took web websites -- addition, he played the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling of, this is no longer challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I'm going to focus on something else, something totally different, and I'm going to focus on it, and I'm going to stand up, and I feel <unk> I've found this thing -- and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This is a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me for not being <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being represented or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have happened then.
They ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where it <unk> it from culture.
And we ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk>
It's considered a naive <unk> to make nice answers to children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
You put the <unk> of <unk> here.
This question does us over and over again as we grow in a lot of ways, <unk> to high school students are asking them to be asked in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise from before you remove the dream.
Why?
Now, if this question inspired children to dream of what they might be, will not inspire to dream of anything you might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't answer it with 20 different things, although adult adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and creative responsibility.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of fate or the true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that show their curiosity and a lot of different things that he wants to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
You could help you divide in three parts: multiple <unk> potential and <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms to <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You would have any term that you like or you might like or you're your own.
It seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in the way that we have this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry.
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
From there the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower, is very fast.
When we <unk> we <unk> we go to it.
We're looking at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our zones.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in full time and a <unk>
As a young girl, <unk> an incredible capacity of developing muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned into writer, I was a financial <unk>
It had to learn the earliest sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this skill helps to write the compelling <unk> for the editors.
<unk> a loss of time is going to have a loss of time to go to what you would tell you even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower superpower, is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transition into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of other other pages designer, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, to sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take a lot of <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
The journal Company Company defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so fast and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams were made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in depth and put in practice, and <unk> offers a span of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we interact with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are told to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring is whatever it is.
If you are a heart heart, then you will go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep their curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric person in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but put it up until it was unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look at a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you knew there would have been living today, we could not give her more help than the one that she <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease.
Since <unk> medicine has gone very long.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer -- antiretroviral people for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, including a lot of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance for Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of your years of Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be wanted to Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's care, costs 200 billion dollars a year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on disease.
Today it's the most expensive, expensive disease and its costs of five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's cancer -- despite the fact that we have Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is because of a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what times you know, but all the world's Alzheimer's world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, engineered with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy person who is healthy compared to the heart of Alzheimer's disease to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to setting up a severe memory loss and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's to reduce life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For about a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these dots <unk> you end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left on the outside.
This makes the molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and identifying how much block we block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in the most part of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, now it's testing a new kind of drugs that they blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos from what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other inside of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We should be aware that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, and <unk> for scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try it a night of the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more and more personal questions, and then they both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would that be?
Number four: When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
And they <unk> these are getting more personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like for him or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've recently met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But we had no time <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I emailed it to the column -- they would be a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably want to be asking you, they keep going on.
And the reason I think you ask this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article would be so nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been asked to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come up with a lot of views like a lot, and those were usually only from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand of the saw.
And that came up with a relatively new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and then the Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday already had called me <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the trust writing with respect to your own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were doing first the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers by proving studying them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public onset together.
And I took the television interviews, and you took the orders of photos from us two.
I think I was afraid to become the distinctive icons of the <unk> process, a range for the one that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> it is, if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real, real, love love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially that people hate the wrong question.
How do you know if you put them together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this particular study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, it was looking for interpersonal and among college students -- using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
Participants feel closer to doing that. Several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they used it between people of global political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university -- and then a student approached me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you get rid of the person who you do it?
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but they became better friends?
You know, I know that they managed to get better to know how to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
And I stumbled upon the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to practically all my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took to the science.
And I did all I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just research for the book I was going to write for but in retrospect, it seems to really be <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad, and I used to have I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm a more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I come from.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than than reasonably much than reasonably me can demand me.
What I look for about love is an orphan, not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because in love with us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's make questions more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves your love, who not?
How do you stay in love when things come together, and how do you know when to cut and cut it down.
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more controversial conversation.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a bit at the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered anything that choice.
I didn't think how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be done enough and responded by 36 questions, and I would have chosen to love someone so generous, kind of fun, and having expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you do, and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the chance of loving someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian in full mountain, and in a way I came like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York makes a time.  One thing that really affected me, but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill for a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time when I was in <unk> <unk> like I went to tour and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took out all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style of Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee kept <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened, somehow it seemed to rise in size, as if it was that I was using the text with a <unk>
So I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements electronic elements, weird bottles that I was finding through the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow up to draw just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects out and created my own taxonomy of specimens from it.
First of all, you think you can make an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, <unk> of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I got stuck.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to wear glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window, and then in another window and another window, and he had all of these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked -- and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> it inspired me largely in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, is Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They're going to be the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where it <unk>
So here is where the creatures with animals are heading by <unk> lists to suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that can be found if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand, while the other hand comes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It has a line of 5.5 feet long, a tail of snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go -- you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made by 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very scary to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material whether you're <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of file in a form of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
It's like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> and this is the chest, the <unk> can be <unk>
I accompany you over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of her chest, and you cover the penis or the <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills that go out and enter the head of this strange statue out.
There's a little forest that is inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a school, a school, a school, a school, a school arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It turns out the box and all of the people within each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we came to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, the religion, not work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have an effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
You will take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will be built in the body.
<unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and increase your tumor cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects -- mostly negative, because in the time you take it to get to the current. You will get worse and worse in the time that it takes you to get to your destiny, which is where it's most important, in the HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph <unk> the system nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and not easily in the blood bloodstream.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV with the current drugs that are a treatment of life being managed by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> for wounds and <unk> surgery -- can be used for anything -- including the transportation transport of medicines.
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, which open up and close holes -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
And we sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're currently testing this in vitro technology or vitro plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, released it directly into the infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream dream of <unk> in our case, an laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied <unk> armed groups as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, what these groups do when they're not shooting <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and no government actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements in 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know the reasons why we think about it, but no one analyzes what they do when not <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also set a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
<unk>
It takes a complex processing of communication stations, radio stations, channels on TV websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have <unk> <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Between armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising tax <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools -- they build hospitals, they run professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state cannot safely and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in a Afghanistan was torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also look at the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price grade for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election from 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they fill themselves <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a landscape, which is running all of its <unk> collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations, and <unk> and the more weak the states are the states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap and no government <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a single military tools.
<unk> that vacuum emptiness has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we understand better than incentives to offer the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, <unk> military power can win some battle, but we don't give us the military and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term long-term investments to fill that vacuum emptiness to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid they accept openly the tag label would be unfair for <unk>
I am a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I got a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke was meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who were <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> the sex.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually the woman and you can't imagine it to be another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also a proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Let's do the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as it would be free of bullying or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and services that are <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our own social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the job, I listen to rap music all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your t-shirt.
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
Let's get poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It comes from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of histories of <unk> <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, is her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I know that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this particular choice, the problem is our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color of color, the gay <unk> and <unk> for white, white, <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist issue.
It also happens this: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would go seamlessly.
When we get to the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself from that <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what it means to be in fear of not being able to fulfill with simple expectations themselves.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> 3,000 meters tall.
It was a show that was a <unk> show to see this pop star over openly Feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless debates if <unk> was or not even a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, very much.
We're going to go much beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to make sure of every single woman, <unk> until I left nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The wrong question or more good, an Feminism -- the more inclusive point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give up the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> of three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
It's where they are <unk> by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as a sport, including the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, engaging in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't raise enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we would have to participate in this kind of projects, and we can also translate it to be more like us as well as we're going to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, people in the power of directors and music producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions more courageous, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim to bravery our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean it about everything, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I joined a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me, and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave another woman I could hear and see me and realize that none of us is the whole thing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I do my <unk> reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most unlikely diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the argument on autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical School.
They don't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and ex-steel who had heard of her create their whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> suffering from funds like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control about Atlanta what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and a better detection detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to explain it, why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital <unk> <unk> Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> private worlds <unk> people around their own parents.
They could tickle them for hours by waving their hands on their face, but they were prey to the panic for <unk> as they weren't put in their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the leading authority of the world in it, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we would give you that diagnosis to children with performance, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine of 10 children sent out for other doctors to his doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> the autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept very carefully in a fridge that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they find in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in the clinic could distinguish 18 <unk> before they turned two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like children were simply telling what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to make their approval out.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought the theory of <unk> mothers from <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband was <unk> and warm people and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a man who is homeless without special education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
We had a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw it was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse diverse was a lot.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have models.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one ever noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the year to the article of <unk> and then he got stuck buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but he avoided <unk> at his own work.
There was no even one translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he spoke German and he would hide it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music classes with music, and the kids follow their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, <unk> described as a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, like I call them their little teachers, and he went to help in development of education methods that were particularly suited to them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of ingredients and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in <unk> culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until I say, that for success and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes didn't fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked out there to reform these <unk> people around the world would see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> teachers and fathers from everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trial to use autism.
You shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that the people with autism and their families would finally support the support and the services that they <unk>
And then Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines of the <unk> and a simple, powerful, credible history of the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If you compare the current estimate of the heart center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right -- the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that these are the puzzles for solving new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people are struggling to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most mundane aspect of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all human intelligence forms on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
